        <h1>On the Way</h1>

        <h2>L.L. Bean Flagship and Outlet shopping</h2>
        <p>
            Break up your drive!<br/>
            I don't know if any of you like L.L. Bean as much as I do (unlikely), but their flagship store is in Freeport, ME. 
            It's really something. They have their own waterways and fish INSIDE. It's an experience.
            Freeport is basically an entire town of L.L. Bean and lots of other outlet stores (Vineyard Vines, Old Navy, Gap, Nike, North Face, all your standards). 
            This is a good one to visit to break up your drive, for those of you that are going to make the journey via car.
            L.L. Bean is open 24/7. Midnight visits are a personal favorite!
            <br/>
            It's right on the way, and about an hour and a half - 2 hours from the Holiday Inn.

        <h1>Wedding Weekend</h1>

        <h2>Take a scenic drive</h2>
        <p>
            Take a drive around Lake Lucerne (ie Phillips Lake on the map).
            You will not be disappointed!<br/>
            Keep in mind it's a big lake and very narrow roads, so it could take up to an hour to drive all the way around.
        </p>

        <h2>Mini Golf and Go Karts</h2>
        <p>
            A classic! 
            <br/>
            Right between the Lucerne Inn and Holiday Inn, it's a quick 5-10 minute drive from either.

        <h2>Hiking</h2>
        <p>
            Enjoy a steep but short 1.5 mile hike to the top of the highest peak in the area.
            You'll be able to look down at the lake and the Inn, and enjoy the beautiful Maine wilderness.
            If you're lucky, there are reports of wild blueberry bushes throughout the trail! 
            They will be ripe - we intentionally planned the wedding so it would fall right in the middle of blueberry season!
            <br/>
            The <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/bald-mountain-loop">hiking directions</a> 
            report that the trail head is not well marked. Be sure to read the comments for tips from previous hikers on where to go.

        <h1>Day Trips</h1>

        <h2>Head down to Mt Desert Island</h2>
        <p>
            Have an extra day or two to explore? <br/>
            Head down to visit Bar Harbor, hike or drive up Cadillac Mountain, and enjoy Acadia National Park!<br/>
            It's only an hour south of the Lucerne Inn!
